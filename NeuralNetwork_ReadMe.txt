Steps to make Neural Network Generator work:

Network Model is numeric representation of nodes in every layer for example 2,2,5,1 means that on the entrance layer there will be two neurons, next layer is also 2, next is 5 and output layer is 1.

Filename is just a textbox where user set's path for textfile that will read already created weights(bias included) for Network Model or it will generate random weights by the application.

Data Instances are predefined values for input layer(Entrance layer values). It has to match with first number in Network Model(example: 0 0 or 0 1) 

Ground Truth is our expected values from output layer(Last layer). It also has to match with last number in Netowork Model(Example: 0; 1; 0; 1;) always for each input set values there has to be output values.

Generate Model should be clicked when we choose every parameter and fileName path is given. It starts Forward Propagation for the model that was given at the beggining in Network Model.

After that we have to click Train button that will launch back propagation on given values. After a short time there should be table with results.




Wariations:

With predefined wages for model:
1. Set values. They have to be valid.(Example is given when application starts)
2. Set path(filename) for file with wages.
3. Click on button Wages from file.
4. Next click Train.

With random wages generated by application and written to file:
1. Set values. They have to be valid.(Example is given when application starts)
2. Set path(filename), doesnt matter if file exists or not, generator will create it automatically.
3. Click button Generate Model.
4. Click Train button.


Generator can be train as many times as needed. There is no need to restart whole application(we can add more epochs and change learning rate, change ground truth values).
If we want to change Network model durning compilation, we have to point new file destination(generate new wages in seperate file) and then click Train for back propagation.
